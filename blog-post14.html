      <article class="blog-post-content">
        <p class="blog-summary">
          Choosing the right web development framework is crucial for creating efficient, maintainable, and scalable applications. In this article, we compare Blazor and ASP.NET MVC in detail, helping you understand which suits your project better.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Technology Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Blazor</strong> is a modern web framework that allows developers to build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. It comes in two flavors: Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly (WASM). <strong>ASP.NET MVC</strong>, on the other hand, is a mature, server-rendered framework following the Model-View-Controller pattern, ideal for building traditional web applications.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Rendering and Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Blazor uses a component-based architecture, similar to modern JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular. It enables developers to build reusable UI components. MVC relies on server-side rendering using Controllers and Razor Views. While Blazor supports SPA (Single Page Application) development, MVC is typically used for MPA (Multi Page Applications).
        </p>

        <h2>3. Interactivity and UX</h2>
        <p>
          Blazor enables rich interactivity without full page reloads, offering a seamless user experience. Blazor Server achieves this using SignalR, while Blazor WebAssembly runs entirely in the browser. MVC applications reload the entire page on every interaction, which can feel slower and less modern in comparison.
        </p>

        <h2>4. SEO and Performance</h2>
        <p>
          ASP.NET MVC is better suited for SEO as it renders full HTML on the server. Blazor Server can also be SEO-friendly, but Blazor WebAssembly requires pre-rendering or JS-based solutions to handle search engine crawlers effectively. In terms of performance, MVC is fast on initial load, whereas Blazor WASM can be slower due to the larger initial payload.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Development Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Blazor offers a modern development experience with full C# and .NET integration on both client and server. It supports component reuse and real-time updates easily. MVC has a simpler model for developers already familiar with Razor and .NET, and is more straightforward for form-based, data-driven apps.
        </p>

        <h2>6. When to Use Blazor</h2>
        <p>
          Choose Blazor when building interactive applications, SPAs, or real-time dashboards. It is also ideal if you plan to reuse components across platforms, including desktop apps via .NET MAUI. Blazor is excellent for internal tools or apps requiring frequent updates without page reloads.
        </p>

        <h2>7. When to Use ASP.NET MVC</h2>
        <p>
          Use MVC for SEO-focused public websites, content-heavy blogs, or traditional web portals where page refreshes are acceptable. It's a solid choice for developers looking for a stable, time-tested framework with robust tooling and community support.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-summary">
          In summary, Blazor is a powerful choice for building modern, interactive web apps using C#. ASP.NET MVC remains a dependable framework for conventional, SEO-optimized applications. Choose based on your appâ€™s complexity, interactivity needs, and long-term goals.
