          SOLID is a set of five design principles that help developers create more maintainable and understandable
          software. These principles are particularly useful for object-oriented programming and can lead to better
          software design and more robust applications.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h2>
        <p>
          The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it
          should have only one job or responsibility. This principle helps in reducing the complexity of a class and
          makes it easier to manage and understand.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</h2>
        <p>
          The Open/Closed Principle suggests that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open
          for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a
          class without changing its existing code, thereby reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h2>
        <p>
          The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a
          subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This ensures that a subclass can be used
          interchangeably with its superclass without unexpected behavior.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</h2>
        <p>
          The Interface Segregation Principle suggests that a client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it
          does not use. Instead of having one large interface with many methods, it is better to have several smaller,
          more specific interfaces.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h2>
        <p>
          The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both
          should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details, but details should
          depend on abstractions. This principle helps in reducing the coupling between different parts of the system.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-summary">
          Applying these SOLID principles helps in creating a well-structured codebase that is easier to maintain,
          extend, and understand. By following these principles, developers can avoid common pitfalls and produce
          software that is more robust and adaptable to changes.
